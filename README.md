FingerMusic
===========

A musical instrument implemented with LeapMotion.

FingerMusic is not played like an average piano, it takes advantage of 3D space.
To play a note: Point your finger toward the screen until a circle appears. 
Move your hand forward till the circle changes color.
Don't try to move your fingers down like a regular piano, it doesn't work.
Move your hand higher to move up an octave.

Happy Playing!
